## Technical Decisions Made

### ‚úÖ Architecture Choices
- **Frontend**: SolidJS + SolidStart (NOT React) ‚úì
- **UI Components**: Park UI + Tailwind CSS ‚úì
- **Backend**: Deno 2.3 + Hono framework ‚úì
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL ‚úì
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime + WebSockets ‚úì
- **Offline**: Deno KV for queue management ‚úì

### ‚úÖ Workflow Requirements Confirmed
- **Fixed 5-Phase Structure**: Planning ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment ‚úì
- **Mixed Task Progression**: Some linear, some dependency-based, all role-aware ‚úì
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Field techs view-only, PMs can reassign, clients high-level only ‚úì
- **Client Visibility**: Public milestones and progress, no task details ‚úì

## Development Approach

### Current Strategy: Frontend-First ‚úÖ
**Rationale**: Build UI components before backend complexity
- ‚úÖ Validate user experience and workflows early
- ‚úÖ Establish component patterns and design system
- ‚úÖ Define API contracts through component needs
- ‚è≥ Implement backend to match frontend requirements

### Next Strategy: API Integration
**Focus**: Connect frontend to working backend
- Database schema implementation
- Role-based API endpoints
- Real-time data synchronization
- Authentication and authorization

## Quality Metrics & Goals

### Performance Targets
- [ ] **Response Times**: < 50ms API responses
- [ ] **UI Performance**: 60 FPS interactions, < 100MB memory
- [ ] **Load Times**: < 2s initial page load
- [ ] **Mobile**: Smooth operation on mobile devices

### Code Quality Standards
- [x] **TypeScript**: Strict typing throughout ‚úì
- [x] **Component Architecture**: Reusable, testable components ‚úì
- [x] **Role-Based Design**: Security-first approach ‚úì
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: 80%+ test coverage target
- [ ] **Documentation**: Component and API documentation

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### üü° Medium Risks
1. **Complex Dependency Logic**: Circular dependencies, performance issues
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing, dependency graph validation
   
2. **Role Permission Complexity**: Security vulnerabilities, access control bugs
   - *Mitigation*: Row Level Security, thorough permission testing

3. **Real-time Synchronization**: Data conflicts, race conditions
   - *Mitigation*: Optimistic updates, conflict resolution strategies

### üü¢ Low Risks
1. **UI Component Complexity**: Already built and validated ‚úì
2. **Technology Stack**: Proven technologies, good documentation ‚úì
3. **Database Schema**: Well-designed, performance optimized ‚úì
