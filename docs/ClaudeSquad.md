Excellent find! Claude Squad is **PERFECT** for your FibreFlow V2 migration. Here's why and how to use it:

## Why Claude Squad is Ideal for FibreFlow V2 ðŸš€

### Perfect Division of Labor:
```bash
Instance 1: Frontend (Solid.js + SolidStart)
Instance 2: Backend (Deno + Hono + Supabase)
Instance 3: Shared Types & Utilities
Instance 4: UI Components (Kobalte + Tailwind)
```

### Benefits for Your Migration:
1. **Parallel Development**: Build frontend/backend simultaneously
2. **No Context Pollution**: Each instance focuses on its domain
3. **Better Coordination**: Shared Git repo keeps everything in sync
4. **Faster Development**: 4x the work in the same time

   - API request/response types
   - Supabase types
2. Create shared utilities
3. Set up API client
4. Coordinate type changes

## Coordination:
- Both frontend/backend import these
- Keep types in sync
- Document all interfaces
```

## Master Coordination Prompt

For the main terminal (not in any Claude Squad instance):

```markdown
# FibreFlow V2 - Migration Coordinator

You are coordinating the FibreFlow V2 migration across 4 Claude Squad instances:

1. Frontend-Solid: Building Solid.js UI
2. Backend-Deno: Building Deno API  
3. UI-Components: Building component library
4. API-Types: Managing shared types

## Project Structure:
fibreflow-v2/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ web/     (Frontend-Solid)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api/     (Backend-Deno)
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ shared/  (API-Types)
â””â”€â”€ README.md

## Current Status:
- [ ] Project structure created
- [ ] Git initialized
- [ ] All instances launched
- [ ] Initial tasks assigned

## Coordination Rules:
1. Types defined first (API-Types)
2. Backend API follows types
3. Frontend consumes API
4. UI components used by Frontend

Track progress and ensure instances work together effectively.
```

## Workflow Example

```bash
# Terminal 1 (API-Types):
"Create Project and Task interfaces"

# Terminal 2 (Backend-Deno):
"Once types are ready, implement GET /api/projects"

# Terminal 3 (Frontend-Solid):
"Once API ready, create projects list page"

# Terminal 4 (UI-Components):
"Create ProjectCard component for the list"
```

## Why This Approach Wins

1. **4x Faster**: Each instance works independently
2. **No Conflicts**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Better Quality**: Each agent becomes domain expert
4. **Real Parallelism**: True concurrent development
